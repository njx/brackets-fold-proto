Totally faked mockup of what it might look like to use a CSS custom filter (shader) to actually
visually "fold" folded code. **Only runs in [Chrome Canary](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/chromesxs).**

Also, you'll need to enable the "Enable CSS Shaders" flag in chrome://flags/

Just click anywhere to see it fold and unfold.
